##    measurement. 
## 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
## 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## 5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set 
##    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
